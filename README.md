This is a chat room Wave gadget. It is called "retro" because arguably the chat
room mode of communication is obsolete inside Apache Wave. It may be useful for
creating gateways to other chat platforms inside a wave.

# History

This gadget was made for Google Wave in 2009. In 2010 Google forked it to work
with their Shared Spaces API, which morphed into the Google+ Hangouts API.
Retro Chat can be used today on Rizzoma and Apache Wave.
